\section{Purpose}
As the software industry continues to expand, it is becoming increasingly important to train developers more effectively. Traditionally, developers are taught theory and then immediately put to work on a complex project without any prior experience. Code katas are short exercises that can be completed in a few minutes and are designed to address this issue. These exercises can involve programming or simply thinking about the issues behind programming. Code katas do not have a single correct answer, but the main point is to learn something from the experience. CodeKataBattle (CKB) is a platform where educators can create tournaments with multiple battles. Each battle is a code kata that is designed to develop various skills. The idea is that students compete in these tournaments in teams to gain practical experience and improve their software development abilities. 
\section{Scope}
As mentioned in the RASD, there are two main users that interact with the system: Educators and Students. Educators are responsible for creating tournaments, which consist of multiple battles grouped by context. For each battle, they must provide a code kata, the number of participants allowed, and a deadline for both registration and submission. Additionally, Educators can allow other colleagues to add new battles to the tournament. To make the tournament a competition, they must also establish the scoring criteria. Lastly, Educators will create badges which will be assigned to each student who meets the criteria indicated in the badge. Students can join one of these tournaments in groups. The platform will then notify them when the competition begins and provide them with a repository containing all the code necessary for the kata. Students must fork this repository and then start working on the solution. They must also set up a GitHub action so that every push they make to the repository during the competition is counted towards their score. Finally, after the deadline, the system will generate a ranking based on their best score.score and the manually evaluation performed by the educator.
